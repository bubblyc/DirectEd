# DirectEd donor side app

**What we do** 

Many talented students in low-income countries lack the economic means to realise their potential, but philanthropists hesitate to donate. The impact of their funds is unclear but attaching conditionality to ensure that funds are used for its intended purpose is costly. DirectEd solve these problems by combining the power of decentralised identifier and blockchain technology to provide a transparent, secure, and low-cost means of making conditional peer-to-peer donations directly to students.

**Overview**

DirectEd works with several workstreams focusing on different aspects of realising our vision. They are divided into several groups as follows:
- Donor side application
- Recipient side application 
- Research (market and product)
- Partnerships 

**This repository**

In this repository you will find the roadmap for the Donor side application.
